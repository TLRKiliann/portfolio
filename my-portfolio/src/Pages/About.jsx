              <h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>
                My name is CÃ©dric, and I'm searching a job in web development.
                I'm very interested by web app, and I will be glade to work with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the last 7 years, my motivation to understand the
                functioning of computer systems has continued to grow.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started by learning HTML5, CSS3 and programming in Python3. Then, I 
                learn more programming languages and how to make web site.
              </p>
              <p>
                My first web site (WAN) was made with PHP, MySQL on raspberry 3 server
                with apache2.
              </p>
              <p>
                With python3, I realized web application without framework. For me it's
                was more interesting to build application with tkinter to interact
                with a server in LAN (Linux, raspberry, SSH, SCP, MySQL).
              </p>
              <p>
                After that, I wannted know how web application works and how can I
                build web API using Node & React.
              </p>
              <p>
                Actually, I'm studying more about web API. I follow fullstack course
                online of University of Helsiniki.

              <p>My goal was to understand how a computer works,
